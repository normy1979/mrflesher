        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p><em>Since I was a child growing up in Hawaii, I've been interested in technology.  I've always been curious about things I don't understand.  I tried to teach myself coding when I turned 20, but I didn't do too well.  Back in 2012 I finally decided that I was going to do what I wanted to do and went back to school for a Computer Science degree.  Since then I've had the pleasure of making web applications for the FAA and a non-profit cat rescue.  Also, my curiosity back to school again to get a Master's degree in Computer Engineering.</em></p>
        <p><em>Most of my work is focused on automation, both at work and at home.  I've automated CI/CD pipelines, testing, and even some of my wifes tedious tasks at her job.  However, I still love to learn and create on the web.</em></p>
        <p><em>When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy hanging at the beach, playing backgammon, and reading.  I try my best to follow the wisdom of the honu, that is to:</em></p>
        <dl>
            <dd>Spend more time at the beach.</dd>
            <dd>Travel at your own pace.</dd>
            <dd>Trust the flow.</dd>
            <dd>Keep moving forward.</dd>
